                COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI) started its journey in 1998, and established its first campus at Islamabad in April 1998. In August 2000, in recognition of CUI's achievements, the Federal Government granted it the status of a Degree Awarding Institute (DAI) through promulgation of its charter. The CUI, besides its principal campus at Islamabad, has six other fully functional campuses at Lahore, Abbottabad, Wah, Attock, Sahiwal and Vehari, while few more campuses are in different planning stages. On the advice of the Federal Government, efforts are also under way for opening an overseas campus in the Gulf region.
                <br><br>
                The CUI is now slated for up gradation as a university by the name of ‘COMSATS University’ through an Act of the Parliament.
                <br><br>
                I feel honored to lead the COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI) as Rector and share with you my vision for CUI, which has always been an innovative institution of learning and development. Our focus in the coming years will be to transform CUI to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing technological environment as well as societal needs through the best affordable academic programs at par with leading global standards, within Pakistan. In short, we envision making CUI "the University of Choice" in Pakistan and across Asia. Although an ambitious vision, but I believe that the talent, skill and experience available at CUI will enable us to achieve success with dedication and hard work.
                <br><br>
                In the years to come, we will extend out-reach of CUI by adding new campuses capable of catering to the high-quality education needs of a larger canvas of aspiring students and researchers. In this regard, we will also encourage public-private partnerships which will pave the way forward and yield impactful results.
                <br><br>
                We are committed to making all out efforts to play our due role in minimizing the adverse effects of the global Coronavirus pandemic and bring to the forefront new technologies and pedagogies to achieve our goals.
                <br><br>
                I would like to assure the parents of our students that CUI will take all possible steps to ensure the safety and well being of your children enrolled at our campuses. We are also deeply committed to inculcate in our graduates the essential skills and professional talent that helps them to meet the needs of the fourth industrial revolution as well as impart industry and market relevant education.
                <br><br>
                I invite you to explore our website and visit our campuses and interact with our students and faculty members, to find out what distinguishes CUI from other leading universities. I am sure you will be overwhelmed by the achievements, faculty and infrastructure of CUI and give us your valuable feedback which will help us build true professionals and global leaders in thinking.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, please join us on our exciting journey into realizing your highest potential; becoming academic leaders in Pakistan and Asia and helping our beloved country by providing impetus to the biggest driver of growth i.e. human resource development.
                <br><br>
                I pray to Almighty Allah for assistance in our future endeavours and look forward to glorious achievements in the times to come.</td>
